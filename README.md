# GoldenUI
**GoldenUI** is a light-weight GUI library for pyglet.

The reason why this library is called GoldenUI is that we use the
[Golden UI](https://opengameart.org/content/golden-ui-bigger-than-ever-edition) pixel
art on OpenGameArt.

It is because it's based on pyglet that GoldenUI has a lot of features, such as loading
images in different formats and supporting multiple platforms.
